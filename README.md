This application makes it difficult to crack the cipher text as the key is only known to the sender and receiver of the message. The plain text is also encrypted using AES encryption which makes it more secure and encryption is done faster. The original plain text is first replaced with some random characters the AES encryption is performed on replaced text. Padding bits are then added to this encrypted text. Thus the cipher text becomes impossible to crack.

Requirements: tomcat server hypercorn (pip3 install hypercorn)

Usage: Go to API folder Run 'hypercorn main:app' 
       start your tomcat server open in browser (localhost:8080)

-> Add the Character and symbol that replaces the character (need to remember for decryption) 
-> Enter the message 
-> Enter the key (need to remember for decryption) 
-> Enter the padding bits for starting and ending (need to remember for decryption)
