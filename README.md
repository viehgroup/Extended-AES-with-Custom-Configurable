# Extended-AES-with-Custom-Configurable
Today, World is moving Fast towards Virtualization. Hence it is very important for the Organization to Encrypt the Critical Data. The Web Application we provide has the facility of enhancing the AES algorithm by adding CUSTOM ENCRYPTION settings in the algorithm, since the AES has been cracked by Attackers in the past. Any known Algorithm has a probability of being Cracked. Here we have proposed algorithm each time he encrypts text. The algorithm uses AES and adds some CUSTOM CONFIGURABLE STEPS in the system where user may modify the encryption process as needed. In this application more steps of encryption are added in order to make the data impossible to decipher by attackers.
